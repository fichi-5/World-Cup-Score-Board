# World-Cup-Score-Board
Project of World-Cup-Score-Board

This project is about a World Cup Score Board. I do a short menu with four options(four simple buttons):
  - Add Match
  - Finish Match
  - Update Score
  - Summary

On the "Add Match" option I display a form with two fields, the local team and the away team. This form creates a match with a state "Started" and a result of 0-0 on the scores. You can add matches as you want, but never withh the same local team and away team.

You can finish a match with the "Finish Match" button. If you click on that button it reveals a list of "Started" matches with a cross. So when you click on the cross that match pass to the "Finished" state.

The button of "Update Scores" shows the list of the "Started" matches with two inputs. Those inputs are the result of each team, if you put a number on that boxes automatically update the scores of that match.

Finally, the last button "Summary" shows the list of the matches ordered by the most recently added and with the highest results of the matches is order descendant.
